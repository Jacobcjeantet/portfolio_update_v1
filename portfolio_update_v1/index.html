        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am trying to break into the web design field in order to learn more about a field that is a major part of my life. I have lived various places up and down the east coast, and my career path up until recently has been in the food industry. I look forward to building websites that fit the buisness since I have seen a lot of hastily put together sites the restaurants where I have worked.</p>
        <p>I am always looking for more ways to expand my skill set and have fun while doing it.</p>
